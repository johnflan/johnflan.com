What if... your social network was not defined by your on-line activity, but was
generated from the people you meet daily, taking into account how regularly you
meet, the time of day, location and duration.

As surprising as it sounds the technology for a network of this type exists
today, not in some shady lab run by Google, Facebook or even Microsoft, but in
our pockets.

Recently I toyed a little with the Facebook Open Graph, and since then I have
been considering how these Object ID's map to the real world. Everything in the
Open Graph is an object in the software development sense and Object ID's are
used to represent individual people, businesses, events, places and activities.

So how can we exchange these ID's quickly and invisibly?

A number of methods exist today to integrate this functionality into say the
Android or iPhone Facebook applications. For example a handset could broadcast
a Wi-Fi SSID of "FB-ID:XXXXXXXX" where X's would represent the users Facebook
Object ID. Bluetooth radios could also be utilised to transmit and receive this
information, offering an advantage of a shorter range (10m or so) enabling the
software to understand that this person was in close physical proximity.
Concurrently, your device on say a thirty-second interval could perform a scan
looking for other devices broadcasting an SSID with a "FB-ID:" prefix. With
this data the software can trivially discover if the detected Object ID's
around you resolve to existing Facebook friends. If they turnout to be valid
object references then record the duration, the location (from GPS) and time of
the meeting, and if the Object ID's dont match existing friends store them for
later analysis.

We can build systems that can dynamically partition these aquantances into
categories like close friends, co-workers, business contacts and others. And
importantly, manage how these relationships change over time  representing your
current real life social network.

Whether or not current wireless technologies are up to this task or if users
would be happy with this level of invasion remain to be seen, but I am
confident that this is how the Facebook of tomorrow will function.

Thoughts or comments are appreciated.
