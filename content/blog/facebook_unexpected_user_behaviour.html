Deactivating your account is a very expensive operation for Facebook. For the
most part, your data is persisted in MySql databases and most users have tens
of thousands of items and maybe more.

In order to deactivate your account they must create a batch job to go through
every database and every entry in each database for that user and set a privacy
flag; the account data persists but it becomes invisible. 

Here comes the interesting part; At some stage it came to light the there were
a group of Facebook users that would deactivate their accounts before going to
sleep. In a way itâ€™s an excellent privacy mechanism, nobody can interact with
you until you reactivate your account. But, for Facebook it was incredibly
painful making database access slow for all users or worst case becoming
unresponsive altogether.

This problem has since been fixed, you may now only deactivate and reactivate
your account a certain number of times in a given period. But, an interesting
aside nonetheless.
