Right turn was the Android based interface to a social traffic aggregation
system. This was created as part of group project work during my time in
[Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/computing/). The overall concept of the project was to integrate Tweets
about traffic in London with data feeds from [Transport for
London](http://tfl.gov.uk), in order to expose social knowledge around traffic events.

##System overview
The backend system collected tweets from Twitter and TfL data feeds which were
stored in a geographic database. To identify valuable tweets; tweets which
discussed traffic, we trained a [naive Bayes
classifier](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) to perform that task. Of
these identified tweets it was discovered that only a small number of tweets
contained explicit geographic information (GPS coords). To maximize the value
of the tweets without geographic information, we attempted to use [reverse
geocoding](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding). This involved a process of creating a regular expression to identify
street and place names and utilised the [Google Maps
API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#ReverseGeocoding) to resolve those names
to geographical locations.
